# R for Data Science

Hi, and thanks for looking at my repository.

In this repo I upload code that I believe is an essential part of a Data Scientists day-to-day arsenal. The code comes from several different resources based on my own work experiences. Be it my teachings at the London Business School, my learnings from DataCamp, my Doctoral Thesis or any other work I have undertaken as a Data Scientist.
